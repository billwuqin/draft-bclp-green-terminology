1.  Introduction

   With rising energy costs and an increasing awareness of the
   ecological impact of running information technology equipment, Energy
   efficiency has been seen to be a critical issue for network
   management systems in relation to environmental impact and
   operational cost.  Energy efficiency management functions and
   interfaces are becoming an additional requirements for network
   management systems.

   This document provides a glossary of terms used in the IETF when
   discussing energy efficiency Network management.  The purpose is to
   provide a comprehensibility and consistent terminology and help with
   Characterization of Energy Efficiency related Information, assist in
   the development of the YANG data models at the different levels in
   the IETF, bring clarity to the Energy efficiency related discussions
   between different groups within IETF or across other across.

   It will touch many aspects of energy efficiency and the vocabulary
   associated with those topics.  It is not meant to be a complete
   description of energy efficiency.  The definitions in this document
   are not normative for IETF standards; however, they are useful and
   standards may make informative reference to this document after it
   becomes an RFC.  Some of the definitions in this document come from
   many earlier IETF documents.  Some of other definitions come from
   documents beyond the IETF.

2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Energy Efficiency:  The concept of energy efficiency refers to the
      ability to use available of energy to achieve a specific benefit
      in a resource conserved manner and at low cost.  The energy
      efficiency is ratio between the useful output and input of an
      energy conversion process of network devices.

   Energy Efficiency metrics:  A set of metrics that are used for
      evaluation of energy consumption and network performance
      characterize the effectiveness of energy management strategy.

   Energy Efficiency Ratio:  The ratio of total throughput (system
      capacity) to the total power consumed (bits/Joule).  It is the
      throughput forwarded by 1 watt and it is introduced in
      [I-D.cprjgf-bmwg-powerbench].  A higher EER corresponds to a
      better the energy efficiency.

   Power Usage Effectiveness:  The metric used to measure data center
      energy efficiency.  It is calculated by the ratio between the
      total energy consumed by the data center and the energy needed for
      IT equipment.

   Network level Energy Efficiency:  Network level metrics are used to
      evaluate the energy efficiency of an entire network or part of it.

   Device level Energy Efficiency:  Equipment/system level metrics are
      mostly used to compare Network equipment of the same functionality
      and place in a network.  They evaluate the overall energy
      efficiency performance at the equipment/system level

   Component Level Energy Efficiency:  Component-level metrics can be
      used in the design, development and manufacture of energy
      efficient equipment.  They regard equipment as an "open box" and
      evaluate the energy efficiency performance of its individual
      components.  Measuring and understanding the energy efficiency or
      energy consumption of each component within the equipment helps to
      identify the “hot spots” and key components in a system with
      regard to energy saving.

3.  Standards Bodies and Standards

   This section describes some of the standards bodies and standards
   that appear in discussions of energy efficiency in the IETF.  This is
   an incomplete and possibly over-full list; listing too few bodies or
   standards can be just as politically dangerous as listing too many.
   Note that there are many other bodies that deal with energy
   efficiency; however, few if any of them appear commonly in IETF
   standards work.

3.1.  Standard bodies

   ITU-T SG5

   ITU-T Study Group 5 (SG5) has already worked on developing standards
   on energy efficiency before IETF is started.  ITU-T SG5 has many
   diverse standards in the environment efficiency field.  These
   standards include L.1310, L.1315, L.1316, L.1320 covering energy
   efficiency terminology, framework, metrics and measurement method.
   In addition, ITU-T SG5 is also is responsible for other standards
   that might be of interest to protocol developers and network
   operators.  L.1331 specifies Assessment of mobile network energy
   efficiency.L.1333 specifies the correlation between the carbon
   intensity indicator and energy efficiency metric.  The carbon KPI
   defined in L.1333 refers to the energy efficiency metric defined in
   ITU-T L.1331.  ITU-T L.1410 deals with the assessment of the
   environmental impact of information and communication technology
   (ICT) goods, networks and services.  It provides specific guidance on
   energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts.

   ETSI TCEE ETSI Technical Committee (TC) Environment Engineering (EE)
   is working together with ITU-T SG5 to develop technically aligned
   standards on energy efficiency and environment aspect.  These
   standards include energy efficiency, power feeding solution, circular
   economy and network efficiency KPI and eco-design requirement for
   ICT, with the aim to build an international eco-environmental
   standardization.  ETSI ES 203 106 defines the energy consumption
   metrics and measurement methods for router and Ethernet switch
   equipment.  It specifies the methodology and the test conditions to
   measure the power consumption of router and switch equipment and is
   also applicable to Core, edge and access routers.

   3GPP SA5 3GPP SA5 has, in Release 17, extended its scope from RAN
   only to the whole 5G system and worked on Energy Efficiency (EE) and
   Energy saving (ES) of mobile networks.  EE Key Performance Indicators
   (KPI) have been defined for the 5G core network and network slices.
   As for RAN, their Energy Efficiency is defined by their performance
   divided by their Energy Consumption (EC), where the definition of the
   performance depends on the type of network entity it applies to.
   From this, SA5 work aimed at defining the best metrics for each of
   them, and their measurement method.  During Rel-18, WG SA5 works with
   ETSI NFV to explore more accurate virtual CPU usage measurements from
   ETSI NFV MANO, Introduce additional metrics when estimating the
   Energy Consumption of Virtual Machines, e.g. their virtual disk or
   link usage.  In addition new use cases for Energy Saving, applied to
   NG-RAN, 5GC and network slicing, AI/ML assisted energy saving
   scenarios are also investigated.

3.2.  Energy efficiency Metrics and Measurement Method

   Metric for DSLAM, MSAM(multiservice access node) GPON GEPON
   equipment:

   Equipment with line cards working at different profiles/states shall
   be characterized with different metric values for each specific
   profile/state.

                         Pport=Peq/Nports[W/port]

   Where Peq is the power (in watts) of a fully equipped wireline
   network equipment with all its line cards working in a specific
   profile/state.

   Metric for wireless access technologies

   The proposed energy efficiency metric at RF unit level is:

                        EErfu= Eoutput/Erfu

   Where Eoutput is daily RF output energy consumption [Wh] under
   different load Erfu is daily RF units energy consumption [Wh] under
   different load.

   Metric for routers and Ethernet switches

   The proposed metric for router and Ethernet switches is:

                       EER=Ti/Pw [Mbit/s/W]

   Where Ti is weighted throughput, Pw is is weighted power (energy
   consumption rate)

   Metric for small network devices

   The metrics adopted for small networking devices intended for home/
   domestic or small office use is

   EER=0.35Tidle+0.5Tlowpower+0.15TMaximum/0.35Pidle+0.5Plowpower_0.15Pm
   aximum (Mbit/s/W)

   Where throughput is maximum non drop data rate beween wide area
   Network and local area network kport in the ingress direction; Line
   rate/speed is maximum possible number of transmitted/received bits.
   Power shall be averaged over 5 minutes, taking measurements every 30
   seconds.  During idle power,IP pings shall be sent via the user
   interface.

   Metric for power equipment

                              δ=Po/Pi

   Where Po is output power, Pi is input power.  This energy efficiency
   value is measured or calculated from the testing data over specified
   time period.

   Metric for cooling equipment

                             η=Qt/Pi

   Where η is the energy efficiency of the air conditioner Pi is the
   input power, Qt is the sum of the sensible cooling capacity and the
   latent cooling capacity.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security is not discussed in this document.
